Open Tije stands for *Open Transportasi Jabodetabek*.

Discover bus stops, transit hubs, and train stations across the Jabodetabek metropolitan area through interactive maps. The goal is to liberate public transportation data and simplify access for everyone by consolidating information from various transport providersâ€”currently scattered across separate appsâ€”into one platform.
